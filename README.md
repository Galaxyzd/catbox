# Catbox Information

[Add catbox to your server](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=538350337803812885&permissions=8&scope=bot)  
**Note:** Catbox is currently not in a stable state. Data might get wiped or lost. Use at own risk.

## I want to have my own catbox

1. Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.
2. Open a terminal in the root folder and run `npm i`.
3. Change values in `config-example.json` to your needs and rename it to `config.json`.
4. In that terminal from earlier run `node catbox` and watch the magic happen.
